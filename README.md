# Tiger Eats Nutrionist Portal

[Tiger Eats](https://tigereats-dev.herokuapp.com/) is a web application built on a React + Flask (Gunicorn) + MongoDB stack that helps school nutrionists track their assigned students and help them meet their nutrition goals. It was completed as a capstone project for Princeton University's course COS 333: Advanced Programming Techniques. Please see the `tigereatssrc` submodule for the source code, as well as further details on how the app is built and deployed. The other files in this repo should help give you a sense of our development process.
