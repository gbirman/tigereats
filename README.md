# Tiger Eats Nutrionist Portal

[Tiger Eats](https://tigereats-dev.herokuapp.com/) is a web application (React + Flask (Gunicorn) + MongoDB Stack) that helps nutrionists track athletes and help them meet their nutrition goals. It was completed as a capstone project for Princeton University's course COS 333: Advanced Programming Techniques. Please see the submodule `tigereatssrc` folder for the source code, as well as relevant details on how the app is built and deployed. The other files in this repo should help give you a sense of our development process.
